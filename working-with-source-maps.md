# Working with Source Maps

`SourceMap` will help you debugging and development.

If we comment it, then in the browser go to the `Sources` tab, we can only see the `js` file, which is not really feasible to debug when we have more complicated code

While enabling the sourceMap, then it will generate the `.js.map` file, which is working as a bridge to allow the browser understand the typescript and enable the debugging ability
