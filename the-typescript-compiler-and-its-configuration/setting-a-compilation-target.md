# Setting a Compilation Target

In the `compilerOptions` there is a field called `target`, it is used to identify which browser target it is compiling into. For example, using the `es5` as the target, the compiled `js` file will not have the `let` keyword - this will allow the app could run in the older browser.

But you are sure that your App will run in the modern browser, you could change it to `es6` which is identical as `es2015` which will have the `let` keyword
