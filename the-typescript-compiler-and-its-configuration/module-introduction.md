# Module Introduction

In this module, we'll take a closer look at the typescript compiler. So for we always just used it by running `tsc` and then pointing at a file which we want to compile. It is not really feasible for bigger projects where you have multiple files or where you simply don't want to run this command.

After every change you want to see in practice in addition to that convenience which we currently we don't have. There also are a couple interesting things you can configure regarding the compilation process which actually change **what** is compiled and **how** it is compiled.
